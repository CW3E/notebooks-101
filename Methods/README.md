# How to Login to comet.
You need to ssh into comet in order to start Jupyter notebooks.
You should have a comet username already, and can use it like so:

`ssh username@comet.sdsc.edu`

Then you will type in your password.

Now you should be at a terminal prompt where you can begin typing in commands. Try out some commands if this is your first time.

If you want to learn and/or become more familiar with the command line, I would recomend the following MIT 'course': https://missing.csail.mit.edu/

Its called the missing semester and has a lot of important topics related to bash.

Once you get a handle on that, you're ready to start a jupyter notebook. Check out one of the methods in this repo. The preferred method is ReverseProxy, since it is more secure.
