# Overview

SDSC [Training events and material](https://www.sdsc.edu/education_and_training/training/index.html) are designed to introduce new and current users to the high performance computing, data, and visualization resources available at SDSC and provide the programming skills necessary to use SDSC resources effectively and efficiently.

Jupyter Notebooks are interactive web tools known as a computational notebooks, in which researchers can combine software, text, multimedia resources, and computational output. Notebooks can be launched locally and access local file systems, or remotely to provide access to a user’s files on the remote system. In the latter case, the notebooks are launched via a process that creates a unique URL that is composed of the hostname plus an available port (chosen by the jupyter application) plus a one-time token. By default, these notebooks are not secure, and potentially expose a user’s local files to unwanted access. In this tutorial, we present SDSC’s multitiered approach to running notebooks more securely.
