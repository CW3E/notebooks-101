# Reverse Proxy Service
hello

this is RPS documentation

## Prerequesites
Ensure that you are ssh'd into comet and you have some jupyter notebooks in you user directory that you want to execute.

## Clone the repository
You should clone the reverse proxy repository into your home directory. It doesn't really matter though, so just make sure its somewhere you can find it.
Run the command `git clone https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/reverse-proxy.git`

## Change into the repository directory
Run the command `cd reverse-proxy/rpsvr_v0`

## Start the jupyter notebook server
Run one of the example commands from `https://github.com/sdsc-hpc-training-org/reverse-proxy`.
At first, don't edit any of the scripts. The scripts are designed so that most new users won't need to edit them.

## Paste the link in your browser
The program will give you an https link. Copy and paste this into your browser.

## Begin using your secure jupyter notebook
Interact with your notebook as you desired. The unfortunate thing about jupyter notebooks is if you forgot to install a particular package before starting the notebook, you will have to use compute time to do this. However, you don't have to wait for your time to be over; you can install packages on the login node while your notebook and still use them in your notebook.
